## Instructions for Repository Owner

1. Create a new branch in the repository (e.g., 'feature/real-time-transcription').
2. Apply the changes from each *_changes.txt file to their respective locations in the project.
3. Install the new dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Test the application by running `npm start` and verifying that the new features work as expected.
5. If everything works correctly, create a pull request to merge these changes into the main branch.

Note: Make sure to update the WebSocket and API endpoints in src/App.js to match your backend configuration before deploying.
